5th Mini Project Assessment: Click Counter App

Objective: The goal of this project is to build a simple Click Counter application using React state. Users should be able to increase or decrease the counter by clicking on respective buttons.

Task Breakdown:
1 Setting Up the Counter Component: Create a functional component to manage the counter. Use the useState hook to store and update the counter value.

 2 Adding Buttons for User Interaction. Add an ”increase” button to increment the counter. Add a “Decrease” button to decrement the counter. Ensure that the counter updates in real time when buttons are clicked.
3 Handling Edge Cases prevent the counter from going below zero (optional). Display a message if the counter reaches a certain threshold (e.g., “You’ve reached the limit”).

Requirements: 
Use React functional components with hooks (useState).
Implement a clean UI with proper styling.
Ensure buttons properly update the state on click.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
